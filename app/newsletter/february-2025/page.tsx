          <Row style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>Y Combinator Research:</Row>
          <Text style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', marginLeft: '2ch' }}>
            I began February by extensively researching Y Combinator's startup methodology and best practices. This research provided valuable insights into product-market fit, rapid development cycles, and how to create solutions that address genuine market needs. These principles heavily influenced my approach to developing InventoryAgent.ai.

          <Text style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', marginLeft: '2ch' }}>
            InventoryAgent.ai is built with a modern tech stack - Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend. The core innovation is its AI engine that learns from business patterns to predict inventory needs, identify supply chain bottlenecks, and suggest optimal pricing strategies. The interface is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring intuitive dashboards and real-time analytics.

            Integration capabilities were a priority from day one. The platform connects seamlessly with popular e-commerce platforms, POS systems, and accounting software. This creates a unified ecosystem for business operations with customizable automation workflows tailored to each business's specific processes.

          <Text style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', marginLeft: '2ch' }}>
            Developing an AI model that could adapt to diverse inventory patterns across different industries required extensive testing and refinement. Another significant challenge was optimizing the real-time synchronization between the Next.js frontend and Supabase backend while maintaining performance. These obstacles pushed me to find innovative solutions and expand my technical skills.

          <Text style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', marginLeft: '2ch' }}>
            In March, I plan to enhance InventoryAgent.ai with image recognition for inventory scanning and implement advanced forecasting algorithms. I'll also focus on creating comprehensive API documentation to facilitate third-party integrations. As the project matures, I'm considering strategies for market testing with potential early adopters.
